<b>Textbook:</b> Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, tenth Edition, by Boyce and DiPrima.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aim:</b> This course is an introduction to differential equations. It is intended for engineering students and others who require a working knowledge of differential equations. Topics to be covered include techniques for solving and applications of ordinary differential equations and an introduction to partial differential equations, separation of variables and Fourier series. The focus will be on understanding the physical meaning of the equations and their solutions, and not on rigorous proofs.
<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> MATH 241.
<br>
<br>
<b>Grading Policy:</b> Webassign homework 20%; Midterms 45% (15% each); Final 35%.
<br>
<br>
<b>Inclusive statement:</b>  This classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, abilities - and other visible or non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon the creation of an Sexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation encouraging and safe classroom environment. Exclusionary, offensive or harmful speech (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.) will not be tolerated and in some cases subject to University harassment procedures. We are all responsible for creating a positive and safe environment that allows all students equal respect and comfort. I expect each of you to help establish and maintain and environment where you and your peers can contribute without fear of ridicule or intolerant or offensive language.

Following most lectures a WebAssign assignment will be posted designed to develop the computational skills and understanding for that lecture. It must be completed before the due time which will always be 12:00 pm.
You are free to discuss the homework with your classmates and your tutors, but we strongly encourage you to understand the solution yourself. Do not assume you understand something just because someone told you how to do it. Remember that no collaboration will be allowed during in-class tests and exams. Your homework average makes up 20% of your final grade.

There will be three written midterm tests, given during regular class times, and a comprehensive final exam. You may not use notes, books, calculators or computers during any of the tests. Each of the midterm exams will be worth 15% of your final grade and the final exam will be worth 35% of your final grade.
Make up tests will be given only if you present written evidence, as soon as possible, that you did (or will have to) miss an exam for a legitimate reason. Medical conditions, religious time conflicts and university related sports competition are examples of reasons for a justified absence. A note that you have visited McKinley is not proof of a legitimate reason. Travel and leisure plans are not a legitimate reason.

• Please come to class prepared. This does not mean you have to understand everything. In fact, if you don’t understand something you will have the opportunity to ask about it and we can discuss it in class.
<br>
• Please let us know if you are having trouble with something, and do so before it becomes an issue on a test or exam. Do make use of office hours and our free tutoring service.
<br>
• While reading your text we strongly encourage you to work through the proofs and examples yourself on paper. This is a very useful way to increase your understanding of the material.
<br>
• After reading something, try to summarize the important concepts. This will help create a mental framework into which to fit the problems you will be working on.
